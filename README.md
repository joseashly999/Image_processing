# Record Pools of Meltwater on George VI Ice Shelf, Antarctica
 This project uses MATLAB image processing toolbox to study the use of image processing techniques to analyze the amount of Ice melting during a period of time in a region

 The Following is the original image captured by the satellite, in 2018 and 2020

 After Running the code the output looks like this. In the preprocessed image it is easier to identify the area increased by the ice melt in the year 2020.
