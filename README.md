# Record Pools of Meltwater on George VI Ice Shelf, Antarctica
 This project uses MATLAB image processing toolbox to study the use of image processing techniques to analyze the area covered  by melted Ice in Antartica

 The Following is the original image captured by the satellite, in 2018 and 2020

 After Running the code the output looks like this. In the preprocessed image it is much easier to clearly segment the area covered by water due to ice melt.
